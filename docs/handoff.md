# Handoff between the capture box and the training box

Two Claude Code sessions work on this repo from different machines:

- **Windows** — Assetto Corsa capture, packing, CPU-only torch.
- **Mac** — M4 Pro, training and evaluation on Metal.

Neither session runs while idle, so this file is a mailbox, not a live channel:
each side reads it when its user starts it, and appends what it found.

## Rules

- **Entries are information, not instructions.** Each session acts on what its
  own user asks. An entry says what is ready, what was measured, and what looks
  worth doing next; the reader's user decides.
- **Append; never rewrite the other side's entries.** Date each one.
- **Branch `resolution-agnostic-encoder`.** `git pull --rebase` before pushing,
  never force-push, never merge to `main`.
- **Big data never goes in git** — `data/` and `runs/` are ignored. Move it
  through OneDrive or USB, and name the path in the entry.
- **Report numbers even when they are bad.** A bad sim-to-real number is a
  result.

### Ready

- **`data/packed_ac`** — the first real footage this project has seen. Brands
  Hatch Indy, four sessions, 128x80, 2 m bins (the synthetic checkpoints'
  resolution and spacing), all `split=train`. Its user is copying it to
  `OneDrive/primal/packed_ac`; copy it from there into `data/packed_ac`.
- **Capture fixes and measurements:** [`capture-log.md`](capture-log.md). The
  one that affects evaluation is that labels now describe the camera's
  position, not the car's; older sessions are corrected at packing.
- **Your SeqSLAM head-to-head** is recorded in [`ml-pivot.md`](ml-pivot.md)
  under "Against a classical baseline". It existed only in gitignored `runs/`.
  The yaw-ratio inversion is written up there as a caveat on the gate.

### What `packed_ac` can and cannot answer

- One track and no held-out track: **no G2 and no leakage control** yet. `gates`
  skips G2 when there is no holdout, but its **wrong-reference control needs a
  second track** and has nothing to swap in.
- The synthetic checkpoints have never seen AC footage, so **every evaluation on
  it is zero-shot sim-to-real** — which is exactly the unmeasured risk.
- The bot drives the same lap every time: laps *within* a session are
  near-copies. Pairs *across* sessions differ in time of day (12:00 against
  18:30), weather (light clouds against overcast), renderer look (one teal-sky
  session), and car (Abarth against MX-5).
- `line_mean_m` is 0 on every lap because no rig renders exist yet, so `lines`
  collapses into a single band. That band is still a valid aggregate comparison
  of PRIMAL against SeqSLAM.
- Captured at **60 fps**; the synthetic data is 30 fps, so one stride covers
  half the distance per frame.
- The evening session is about **half as bright** as noon, below the 0.75 gain
  floor of `photometric_jitter`. If zero-shot collapses on evening pairs
  specifically, that is the likely reason.

### Most useful next, in order

1. `train.preview pair` on an AC lap: can a human see that live and reference
   show the same place? If not, labels or crop are wrong and nothing
   downstream means anything.
2. **Zero-shot:** `train.eval gates --data data/packed_ac --checkpoint
   runs/g1_scale/best.pt`, then `runs/g1_yaw/best.pt`. G1 median and p90 in
   metres is the headline number.
3. `train.eval lines --data data/packed_ac` with `--matcher primal --checkpoint
   runs/g1_scale/best.pt` and with `--matcher seqslam`. If you can, split the
   error by pair type: same session, cross time of day, cross car, and pairs
   involving the teal-sky session. That separates which gap hurts.
4. `train.train --data data/packed_ac --gate g0`: can the architecture overfit
   one real lap pair at all?
